# Smart-Lock

Here I designed a smart lock for costumer use. This smart lock can save up to 3 different 4-digit passwords, which are also easily removable.

Initialize: When customers first install the smart lock, there are no saved passwords. Therefore, customers must save at least one password before closing the door.
 
Regular use: If customers saved their passwords already, only need to input one correct password to unlock the door. After the input of 4-digit correct password, the door will automatically open.

Password save and delete function are only accessible when the door is unlocked.

Save: Customers can only save up to 3 passwords, and will receive an error signal as trying to save the 4th one. For password saving, customers need to input an exact 4-digit password and press enter. If the inputted password is already saved, customers will also receive an error signal.

Delete: To delete a password, customers need to first input this password correctly and click delete. Donâ€™t ask me how to delete a password you forgot : )

Have fun with it!
